FILESYMBOL
Most of operations if Ruby plugin is made using info recieved from filesymbols.
Filesymbol is used to describe structure of ruby objects. We support these types of structural elements:
1. classes
2. object classes (class <<self; end)
3. modules
4. constants
5. fields
6. fields access attributes (attr_reader, attr_writer, attr_accessor, attr_internal)
7. methods
8. singleton methods
9. aliases
10. global variables
11. require (require "foo")
12. load (require "foo")
13. include (include Mixin)
14. extend (extend Mixin)
15. include_class
16. include_package
17. import

After evaluation of filesymbol we know structures of classes, modules, etc and their relations
i.e. module A is mixined to class B, class C is superclass of class D, etc.

SYMBOLS CACHE
We store special symbols cache to store recently evaluated filesymbols.
Cache is divided into 2 parts: hard cache and soft references cache.
Hard cache stores builtin layers, i.e. layers that dont depend on module files.
For example BuiltinLayer is used to store filesymbol for given sdk and RailsBuiltinLayer
to store filesymbols for given sdk and rails gems.


LAYERS
Layers system is constructed to reduce speed of filesymbol evaluation.
When you work with file in the editor you work with Modifiable cached symbol.
It divides the whole filesymbol into 2 parts: outer filesymbol, consisting of
outer filesymbol and outer requires of given ruby file.


BUILTINS

We have 2 builtin layers.
BuiltinLayer is used as base layer for Ruby modules and java modules with JRuby facet.
RailsBuiltinLayer is used as base layer for Rails or java modules with JRuby (?) and or JRails facet.

MODULE LAYERS
This is layers one step higher than builtins and used to add user directories to loadpath
(patches corresponding fileSymbols) and to add rails specific directories to loadpath.

All Rails layers are based on RailsModuleLayer.

RAILS LAYERS

Rails layers are used to form layers hierarhy for Rails applications.

Contract used when deciding which Rails layer use as base symbol for modifiable symbol:

Controller:             MODELS_LAYER;
Helper or View:         MODELS_LAYER
Model or Migration:     LIBS_LAYER
Tests:                  CONTROLLERS_AND_HELPERS_LAYER
ActionMailer:           MAILERS_LAYER
WebService:             WEBSERVICES_LAYER

Rails layers hieararhy:
1 group
    CONTROLLERS_AND_HELPERS_LAYER,
    MODELS_LAYER,
    LIBS_LAYER,
    VENDOR_LAYER,
    RAILS_MODULE_LAYER,
2 group
    MAILERS_LAYER,
    LIBS_LAYER,
    VENDOR_LAYER,
    RAILS_MODULE_LAYER,
3 group
    WEBSERVICES_LAYER
    LIBS_LAYER,
    VENDOR_LAYER,
    RAILS_MODULE_LAYER,

MODIFIABLE LAYER

Divides the whole fileSymbol into 2 separate parts:
1. only content of ruby file, ignore outer requires
2. base layer for this filesymbol and file`s own outer requires.
